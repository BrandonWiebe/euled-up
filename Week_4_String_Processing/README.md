# String Shenanigans

This week is a set of small string processing challenges to get us used to using string and text in our chosen languages. Thanks to Jim for this idea!
* Get the first word in a string.
* Count the most common words in a string.
* Output the longest line in a string.
  * Bonus: Output all of the longest lines if there's a tie.
* Output groups of characters as they appear in a string. So "hello old wool" would be output as "h, e, ll, o, o, l, d, w, oo, l".
* Get the substring of a string.
* Replace all occurrences of a character in a string with another.
  * Bonus: Allow the replacement to be a string rather than a character. The replacement string can be of any length.
* Match a string against a regex pattern (Usage of libraries is allowed!)
* Substitute part of a string using a regex pattern (Usage of libraries is allowed!)

Hard mode (these may not apply to all of the above problems, and may not apply to your chosen language!):
* Be wary of the encoding of the strings in the above problems (ie support unicode). Try with UTF-8 and UTF-16 encodings.
* Do not use numerical comparisons in the above problems. Using equality is okay, but do not compare the length of a string.
* Do not use lists in the above problems.
* Do not use arithmetic operators in the above problems. (So no ++ or i += 1!).

"Just for Jim" (a separate problem to choose from if you want something bigger): 
* Implement one or more edit distance algorithms as described here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edit_distance

We like this one because it covers:
* How to use strings and text.
* Calling functions.
* Using maps/dicts.
