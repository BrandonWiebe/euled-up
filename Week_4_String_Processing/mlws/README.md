Running

To run you need the [JDK 8+](https://adoptopenjdk.net/) and [Leiningen](https://leiningen.org/). Once you have those you can run:

    $ lein test

Learnings

- finally reached a decent IDE setup
- getting to grips with Clojure's testing framework (which is built-in, yay!)
- learning some string manipulation functions which is ace cos you always end up needing them
- Clojure's standard library is pretty great (as it should be!), and has great [docs](https://clojuredocs.org/)
