CSV Data
===

This week I was tired and only did the minimum. I'm also working on another project in Clojure to do comparison on data files (including CSVs!) so I'd had enough of CSV files for the week ðŸ˜‚.

Learnings
---

- I learnt about how to do destructuring in Clojure
- Good to actually write a `reduce` function
- Got to use `comp` to compose functions which was nice
- I didn't refactor to make the two rugby/weather use the same logic because idk it felt icky :<
