Number Guessing Game

Coding challenges in Clojure with my friend Bealea.

I chose [Clojure](https://clojure.org/) for a few reasons:
- It's a LISP which is kind of challenging coming from mainly C family languages, but also has some interesting ideas (like code = data)
- I like functional programming so learning how to use a functional-first language appeals to me. I find FP bends my brain in kind of interesting ways, and there are lots of interesting ideas that you can bring into non functional-first languages
- One of my main languages in my day job is Java. Since Clojure also runs on the JVM, this means if I actually get good enough with it there's a possibility of using Clojure at work! I actually think it's quite a good fit for some of the problems I deal with at work.

Running

To run you need the [JDK 8+](https://adoptopenjdk.net/) and [Leiningen](https://leiningen.org/). Once you have those you can run:

    $ lein run

Learnings

- shouting at the compiler
- getting my IDE setup vaguely
- working a bit with user input
- defining functions to do literally everything
- getting a game loop working with recursion
