# Week 1 - Guess the number

First problem:
http://rosettacode.org/wiki/Guess_the_number/With_feedback

Write a game that follows the following rules:

* The computer chooses a number between given set limits.
* The player is asked for repeated guesses until the the target number is guessed correctly
* At each guess, the computer responds with whether the guess is:
* higher than the target,
* equal to the target,
* less than the target, or
* the input was inappropriate.

We like this one because it covers:

* Compiling your first program
* Variables syntax (including integer and string types)
* Using loops
* Outputting to the terminal
* Numeric comparisons
* (Language dependent) Error handling
* Receiving user input
