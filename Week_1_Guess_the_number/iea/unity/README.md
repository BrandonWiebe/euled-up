# Guess Number

Attempt of an FPS approach to the guess number problem.
Targets floating around the player are the valid options;
the player, who can only change rotate the view, shoots at them.

If the guess is correct some fireworks spawn from the 
correct target. Otherwise we log debug (for now) to try harder..
