# Noughts and Crosses


The goal is to write the perfect AI for a noughts and crosses (tic tac toe) game.
Write a function that, when given a series of moves by each player, will use a decision tree to decide on the next best move to make (as pictured on https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tic-tac-toe#Strategy).

Hard mode:
* Render the output of the function on a grid
* Build the AI into a fully functioning game.
  * Randomise who goes first, you or the computer.
  * Reject invalid input.
  * Notify when there is a winner.

We like this one because it covers:
* Basic classes to store the decision nodes
* Recursion or stacks

You'll also be building on the concepts that you learned this week:
* Defining lists, changing their contents
