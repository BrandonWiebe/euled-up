Running

To run you need the [JDK 8+](https://adoptopenjdk.net/) and [Leiningen](https://leiningen.org/). Once you have those you can run:

    $ lein run

Press 1-9 to enter a `O` in that square, like a number pad.

Learnings
---

- more shouting at the compiler
- so many functions
- used same game loop setup
- a much bigger problem - I started by implementing the absolute simplest rules and worked upwards from there
- still not sure about how best to deal with scope/closures, ended up passing certain values around everywhere
- I gave up when getting to the rules about forks üç¥
- was challenging and fun!
